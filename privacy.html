									<h2>The future of privacy</h2>
								</header>
								<p>These days we are being tracked all the time, like the US, the UK government has a history of mass surveillance and data collection, with the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act solidifying their power. This act allows some government agencies to:</p>
							  <ul>
								  <li>•	Order ISPs (Internet Service Providers) to store records of your browsing history, the devices you use and your IP Address.</li>
								  <li>•	Hack into computers and phones, and order companies to assist them in doing so.</li>
						      </ul>
							  <p>With many agencies being allowed to access this data without a formal warrant.</p>
							  <p>While we are being tracked in several other ways by the government, when it comes to the track and trace system, the data collected must only be used for the tracing of Covid-19 infections and must be in accordance with the 2018 Data Protection Act.</p>
							  <p>However, governments are not the only ones with this kind of tracking capability.</p>
							  <p>Social media giant Facebook has famously been exposed for collecting all the data it can find out about you, this can include your hobbies, employment status, what pets you even and most shockingly, your live location. Not only that, in 2018, it was found that Facebook had not secured this data properly and other companies were using it for political advertising.</p>
							  <p>Facebook is far from the only company collecting your online data either, and due to how important the internet is these days, it is hard to avoid giving your data over to someone else. For example, to use any Google services, you must allow Google to track you, and to use Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram, you are ultimately signing up to Facebook’s data collection.</p>
							  <p>However, it is not all hopeless, there are some companies taking a stand in the name of privacy. Apple is very vocal on its views on user privacy, in its latest update of iOS, it now requires apps to disclose what data it collects before it is approved to be put on the app store. iOS devices also notify the user when an app is using your location, camera, or microphone. This has helped expose shady data collection by apps like TikTok. Apple has also refused to work against government powers like the FBI when they have been ordered to unlock devices.</p>
							  <p>Tools like VPNs can be used to mask your location and IP address from websites and hide some data from your ISP and the government. Some communication services like Signal and Telegram offer end to end encryption on your messages so that they cannot be intercepted and looked at by a third party, but that is not always a guarantee of full privacy, as seen with WhatsApp.</p>
							  <p>All in all, it is undeniable that to fully participate in the digital world, there may be no choice but to sacrifice some privacy, but as more people become aware of tracking, more people are take a stand against it, so privacy might not be dead just yet.</p>
