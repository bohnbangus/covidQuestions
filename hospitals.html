									<h2>Automation in a hospital</h2>
								</header>
								<p>What the hospital already has is an embedded real time system, this means it is an OS (operating system) built specifically for the hospital hardware, that has extremely fast response times and the ability to deal with simultaneous inputs. Real time systems also have failsafe and backup systems. This is appropriate for the hospital as any failure or delay in the system could cause serious harm.</p>
								<p>The proposed update could be extremely useful as the system can respond to sensors and vital data much quicker and more reliably than hospital staff, meaning it can calculate more effective doses of drugs.<br>
								</p>
								<p>A computer can also measure out doses more precisely than a staff member and deliver them at exactly the right time. This removes the possibility of human error when delivering drugs, which can be dangerous as too much or too little of a dose at the wrong time can seriously affect a patient’s health. It may also be cheaper for the hospital as no drugs are wasted due to human error.</p>
								<p>However, while the possibility of human error is removed, when working with a system there is always a chance of failure, this could be from:</p>
							  <ul>
								  <li>•	Bugs in the software</li>
							    <li>• Incorrect readings from sensors.</li>
							    <li>• Details of a patient being input incorrectly.</li>
							    <li>• System sabotage</li>
							    <li>• Failure in the hardware</li>
<li'></li'>
						      </ul>
							  <p>Failures could result in doses not being delivered or being delivered incorrectly, which could lead to patients getting more sick or even dying. To lessen the chance of failure, the system would always need a failsafe in place and a trained technician on site in case of emergency.</p>
							  <p>There is also the fact that some patients will not be comfortable with trusting their drug doses to machines, and would prefer to have them hand delivered, so some staff will still need to be on hand. If the system does get updated, not as many staff will be needed I the hospital ward, so this could lead to staff being made redundant.</p>
							  <p>I think that the update could be implemented as it could end up being safer than human dose delivery, but it would need several backups to be safe, a technician on site, and it must still be an option for medical staff to deliver the doses, in case of system failure, emergency or from request of patients.</p>
