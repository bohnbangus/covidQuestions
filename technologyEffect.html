									<h2>How technology affected our pandemic lives</h2>
								</header>
								<p><strong>In the past,</strong> during a pandemic, workers would have no choice but to either come into work anyway or be made redundant. Retail and food businesses would greatly suffer as most people would not be willing to risk their lives to shop or eat out. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
								<p>However, as computers and the internet were developed, the nature of work and retail changed. Retail businesses could operate without the need of physical storefronts, instead opting for online shops with delivery or collection. As well as this, office workers now had the option of working from home if they needed to, as companies could put all their resources on the cloud or a shared network.&nbsp;<br>
								</p>
							  <p>&nbsp;This development unknowingly prepared us for the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
							  <p>Thanks to the use of technology, office workers can work from home relatively easily, they can even organise meetings using online conferencing software. All that’s required is a computer and an internet connection. Similarly, many retailers and food outlets have been able to stay open during the pandemic, using online websites and delivery to homes. Most restaurants who would have had to shut completely have been able to link up with apps like Just Eat and Deliveroo to take orders and have them delivered to customers.</p>
							  <p>This has undoubtedly saved thousands of people from real money problems, as well as keeping their mental health intact as they have been able to stay active and working, with things to do with their time.</p>
							  <p>When working from home, being able to still talk with co-workers using online conferencing apps like Zoom has also helped people stay social when they may not talk to another person face to face for weeks. Social isolation can be a trigger for mental illness, so any social interaction helps a person’s wellbeing greatly.</p>
							  <p>On the other hand, the ease of being able to work and order shopping completely from home has led to people no longer having the need or motivation to leave their houses and experience the outside world, effectively cutting themselves off from the rest of society. The effects of this can be severe, as it has been shown that the more a person stays in one place, the more they will never want to leave that place, creating a depressing cycle.</p>
								<p>As well as this, not everyone has been able to adapt to online work, some stores may not have the resources to move to an online website and do delivery, leaving them behind while other stores profit. Working from home is also not the easiest thing to get used to, many workers are not be comfortable working in the same place that they live, as there is no separation between work space and break space, making it hard to motivate yourself to work. As a result, the reports of mental health issues to workplaces has skyrocketed.</p>
								<p>Overall, technology in general has been an amazing lifeline to workers during this pandemic, as it has allowed them to keep earning money at a stable pace when everything else is unstable. However, it also brings its own problems in the form of mental health issues and stress.</p>
