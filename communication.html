									<h2>How communication changed during the pandemic</h2>
								</header>
								<p>The availability of portable, online communication has allowed the world to say in contact during this pandemic. Where in the past, the most contact a person could have during lockdown is with anyone living with them, nowadays we can stay in touch with everyone we know, and even make new friends. Not only that but we have a great variety in the ways we can communicate with other people, whether it be through messaging apps, video chats or just a plain phone call, it is now easier than ever to get in touch with another person.</p>
								<p>Naturally, this has had a great impact on society during the pandemic, it has meant we have been able to adapt to the lack of physical contact relatively easily. As a society we shifted to completely online based communication immediately, with downloads of chat apps like Zoom and WhatsApp increasing exponentially at the beginning of lockdown. As a result, we have been able to keep safe and stay inside while at the same time not isolating ourselves socially, at a time when loneliness and isolation is a real danger to everyone.<br>
								</p>
								<p>This change has also allowed people to stay in touch with others who may be at risk of mental health issues, making sure that they are coping okay, and being able to help each other to survive this tough time. As a society, we can come out of this pandemic better than we came in, in part due to our ability to call on others for help and support using these new incredible means of communication.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, this shift in communication may be a problem when we eventually do come out of this pandemic and it is safe to return to our normal lives. It is very likely that as a society we have lost some ability to communicate face to face, meaning some of us may struggle to return to physical interaction, whether it be at work or with our friends, and as result, may isolate ourselves inside anyway, regardless of any lockdown. This sudden return to physical, face to face communication in society may end up leaving some people behind.</p>
								<p>Our new digital means of communication have been invaluable during this pandemic, ensuring that we can isolate physically without isolating socially, but it is important that we all return to physical interaction when it is safe to, otherwise we might never be able to fully go back to how it was before the pandemic.</p>
